# SQL Test Task Repository

This repository contains a test task for candidates who will work with SQL. The task includes working with a PostgreSQL database and executing various SQL queries.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- SQL client (DBeaver, TablePlus, PgAdmin, DataGrip, or other)

### Database Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sql-test-task
```

2. Start the PostgreSQL Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Verify that the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

**üìä Data Loading**: The database automatically initializes with:
- **Base dataset**: ~54 customers, ~59 products, ~55 orders, ~85+ order items
- **Duplicate test data**: ~20+ additional records with realistic data quality issues for deduplication tasks

## üîå Connection Details

- **Host:** localhost
- **Port:** 5432
- **Database:** test_db
- **Username:** test_user
- **Password:** test_pass

## üìä Table Structure

The database contains 4 tables with corresponding relationships:

### `customers` - Customers
- `customer_id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY) - unique customer identifier
- `first_name` (VARCHAR(50)) - first name
- `last_name` (VARCHAR(50)) - last name  
- `email` (VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE) - email address
- `phone` (VARCHAR(20)) - phone number
- `registration_date` (DATE) - registration date

### `products` - Products
- `product_id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY) - unique product identifier
- `product_name` (VARCHAR(100)) - product name
- `category` (VARCHAR(50)) - category
- `price` (DECIMAL(10,2)) - price
- `stock_quantity` (INTEGER) - quantity in stock

### `orders` - Orders
- `order_id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY) - unique order identifier
- `customer_id` (INTEGER) - customer identifier (FK ‚Üí customers)
- `order_date` (TIMESTAMP) - order date and time
- `total_amount` (DECIMAL(10,2)) - total order amount
- `status` (VARCHAR(20)) - order status

### `order_items` - Order Items
- `order_item_id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY) - unique item identifier
- `order_id` (INTEGER) - order identifier (FK ‚Üí orders)
- `product_id` (INTEGER) - product identifier (FK ‚Üí products)
- `quantity` (INTEGER) - quantity
- `unit_price` (DECIMAL(10,2)) - price per unit

## üéØ Interview Tasks

Execute the following SQL queries organized by difficulty level:

### 1. Basic Queries (Beginner Level)
- Get a list of all customers with their contact information
- Find all products with a price greater than $500
- Show all orders from the last month

### 2. Table Joins (Beginner-Intermediate Level)
- Get a list of orders with customer names
- Show order details with product names
- Find customers who have not made any orders yet

### 3. Aggregate Functions (Intermediate Level)
- Count the total number of orders for each customer
- Find the most expensive product in each category
- Calculate the average order amount

### 4. Complex Queries (Intermediate Level)
- Find the top-3 most popular products by sales quantity
- Get customers with total order amount greater than $2000
- Show products that have never been ordered

### 5. Data Modification (Intermediate Level)
- Add a new customer
- Update order status
- Increase the price of all products in the "Electronics" category by 10%

### 6. Data Quality & Deduplication (Intermediate-Advanced Level)

**‚úÖ Automatic Setup**: Duplicate data scenarios are now automatically loaded during `docker-compose up`! The database includes:
- Customer duplicates with name/email/phone variations
- Product duplicates with different stock levels and pricing
- Potential duplicate orders (same customer, timing, amounts)
- Email and phone number formatting inconsistencies

**No additional setup required** - all duplicate test data is ready for deduplication tasks.

**Tasks:**
- Find duplicate customers by name and phone number
- Remove duplicate products keeping the one with highest stock_quantity
- Identify potential duplicate orders (same customer, same day, similar amounts)
- Find customers with similar email addresses (consider +tags, different domains)
- Create a strategy to merge duplicate customer records while preserving order history

### 7. Window Functions & Analytics (Advanced Level)
- Rank customers by total purchase amount using window functions
- Calculate running totals of daily sales
- Get top 3 products per category using ROW_NUMBER()
- Calculate moving averages of order amounts (7-day and 30-day windows)
- Identify gaps between customer orders using date functions

### 8. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) (Advanced Level)
- Create customer segmentation (new, returning, VIP, churned) using CTEs

### 9. Advanced Date & Time Analysis (Advanced Level)
- Perform seasonal sales analysis by quarter and month
- Calculate customer retention cohorts (monthly cohort analysis)
- Find average time between first and second purchase
- Identify peak shopping hours and days of the week
- List customers who haven't ordered in the last 30 days
- Calculate business days between order and shipment (excluding weekends)

## üí° Tips for Interviewers

- **Start with basics** and progressively increase difficulty based on candidate responses
- **Focus on problem-solving approach** rather than perfect syntax
- **Ask candidates to explain their thought process** while writing queries
- **Discuss alternative approaches** and trade-offs
- **Include performance considerations** for senior roles
- **Test both query writing and query optimization** skills

## üõë Stopping the Container

To stop the container, execute:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

To completely remove (including data):
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## üìù Notes

- All test data is created automatically when the container starts
- The database remains accessible while the container is running
- Data changes are stored in Docker volume and are not lost on restart
